CVKInjector is a simple dependency injection helper for Objective-C. All you have to do is register
a class with the injector, and then request an object by interface from the place you need it.

No fancy macros, no additional syntax, no auto-injected Spring-like stuff. Plain, clean Objective-C
which is understandable by anyone.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

CVKInjector is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "CVKInjector"
